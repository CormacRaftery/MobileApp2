# MobileApp2
This was an attempt at a project given to me in third year software development by Damien Costello for the module Mobile Applications Development 2.

The goal I had started with was as in my design document to create an app that ran a couple of tabletop games such as Snakes & Ladders, connect4, counters and possibly more. I expected that I would be able to save these games as I wished and I have partially reached this goal as my application stores snakes and ladders games locally but not between sessions as I originally wished.

Upon launching the application the user is presented with the saved games from the default sample storage and the user has the option to resume these games or create their own new one.
